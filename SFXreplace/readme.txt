This was only meant for my convenience, but others might find this useful.
Steam automatically replaces modified sound files each time it starts up. (fucking why)
This application is for fighting that.
Replace the sound files in the installation package to whatever you desire.
By default the message sound is changed, and call rings are muted because it's too convenient of a tool for others to rape my ears.


Installation:
Place the "SFXreplace" folder with all its contents in the same folder as "Steam.exe".
Usually this will be "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\"

Start with Windows:
In the newly placed "SFXreplace" folder, right click and create a shortcut to "SilentSFXreplace".
After that, open the windows run prompt (Windows key + R) and enter "shell:startup".
In that folder, place the shortcut.
(This mode waits 5 minutes before copying the files over so that Steam has time to fully start up. If your Steam takes longer than 5 minutes to start up, you have greater concerns.)

Note:
If for whatever reason you have to restart Steam, it will replace the modified sound files again.
Run "CopyFilesNOW" to manually replace them again. (or for create a shortcut for convenience)


You probably won't get VAC'd.
